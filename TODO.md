- Primer FASTA outputs from `generate_primers.py` should have target position "offset" info in their FASTA record descriptions

- It would be nice to have a script for adding "overlap" & "common" subsequences, and also renaming candidate primer sequence (descriptions) so that they're short enough for wetlab label use. This script will require that the user knows which orientation each primer type should be. A diagram (adapted from e.g. McDaniel 2016) would be helpful.
